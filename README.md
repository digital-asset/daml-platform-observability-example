# Daml Enterprise - Observability Example

This project demonstrates a [Daml Enterprise](https://www.digitalasset.com/products/daml-enterprise)
deployment's observability features, along with example Grafana dashboards.

The project is self-contained: providing scripts to generate requests for
which metrics are collected for display in the Grafana dashboards. It requires
Daml `2.6.5` or newer and has been tested on MacOS and Linux.

**This project is provided for illustrative purposes only, the various configurations
are tailored for local run and may not fit other use cases.**

**This repository does not accept contributions at the moment.**

Use the `Makefile` ‚Äî run `make help` for available commands!

## üö¶ Prerequisites üö¶

* [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [**Docker Compose V2 (as plugin `2.x`)**](https://github.com/docker/compose)
* (Optional) Digital Asset Artifactory credentials to access private [Daml Enterprise container images](#accessing-daml-enterprise-container-images)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Docker compose V1 is deprecated and incompatible with this project**, check [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/).
One sign you are using the wrong version is the command syntax with a dash instead of a space:
`docker compose` (V2 ‚úîÔ∏è) VS `docker-compose` (V1 ‚ùå).

Docker Compose will automatically build the [image for the HTTP JSON API service](./daml-service/)
from the release JAR file.

The [`.env`](./.env) file has environment variables to select which Canton and Daml SDK versions
are being used. See [this section below](#accessing-daml-enterprise-container-images) for more details.
Please be aware that using a different Daml Enterprise version may not generate all the metrics used in
the Grafana dashboards, some things may not show up.

## TL;DR

To quickly get up and running, make sure you have the all [prerequisites](#Prerequisites) installed and then:

* Ensure you have enough CPU/RAM/disk to run this project; if resource limits are reached, a container can be killed.
Canton can use over 4GB of RAM for example.
* Start everything: `docker compose up`
* Create workload: there are various scripts that generate load, run them in different terminals:
  * `scripts/generate-load.sh` (generates gRPC traffic to the Ledger API running the conformance tests in loop)
  * `scripts/send-json-api-requests.sh` (generates HTTP traffic to the [HTTP JSON API Service](https://docs.daml.com/json-api/))
  * `scripts/send-trigger-requests.sh` (generates HTTP traffic to the [Trigger Service](https://docs.daml.com/tools/trigger-service/))
* Log in to the Grafana at [http://localhost:3000/dashboards](http://localhost:3000/dashboards) using the default
user and password `digitalasset`. You can lower the time range to 5 minutes and refresh to 10 seconds to see results quickly.
* When you stop everything, it is recommended to [cleanup everything](#cleanup-everything) to start fresh next time.

You should see a dashboard like this:

## Components

Docker Compose will start the following services:

* PostgreSQL database server
* Daml Platform
  * All-in-one Canton node (domain topology manager, mediator, sequencer and participant)
  * HTTP JSON API service
  * Trigger service
* Monitoring
  * Prometheus `2.x`
  * Grafana `9.x`
  * Node Exporter
  * Loki + Promtail `2.x`

Prometheus and Loki are [preconfigured as datasources for Grafana](./grafana/datasources.yml). You can add other
services/exporters in the [Docker compose file](./docker-compose-observability.yml) and scrape them changing the
[Prometheus configuration](./prometheus/prometheus.yml).

## Startup

Start everything (blocking command, show all logs):

```sh
docker compose up
```

Start everything (detached: background, not showing logs)

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

If you see the error message `no configuration file provided: not found`
please check that you are placed at the root of this project.

### Starting a Remote Canton Console

```sh
docker exec -it daml_observability_canton_console bin/canton -c /canton/config/console.conf
```

## Stopping

* If you used a blocking `docker compose up`, just cancel via keyboard with `[Ctrl]+[c]`

* If you detached compose: `docker compose down`

### Cleanup Everything

Stop everything, remove networks and all Canton, Prometheus & Grafana data stored in volumes:

```sh
docker compose down --volumes
```

## Important Endpoints to Explore

* Prometheus: http://localhost:9090/
* Grafana: http://localhost:3000/ (default user and password: `digitalasset`)
* Loki: http://localhost:5000/ (default user and password: `digitalasset`)
* Participant's Ledger API endpoint: http://localhost:10011/

Check all exposed services/ports in the different [Docker compose YAML] files:
* [Canton](./docker-compose-canton.yml)
* [Daml services](./docker-compose-daml-services.yml)
* [Observability stack](./docker-compose-observability.yml)

### Canton Console

```sh
docker exec -it daml_observability_canton_console bin/canton -c /canton/config/console.conf
```

### Logs

```sh
docker logs daml_observability_postgres
docker logs daml_observability_prometheus
docker logs daml_observability_grafana
```
You can open multiple terminals and follow logs (blocking command) of a specific container:

```
docker logs -f daml_observability_postgres
docker logs -f daml_observability_prometheus
docker logs -f daml_observability_grafana
```

## Configuration

### Canton and HTTP JSON API Log Level

For the Canton node and HTTP JSON API service only, you can change `LOG_LEVEL` in the [`.env`](./.env) file:

```sh
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

### Prometheus

[`prometheus.yml`](./prometheus/prometheus.yml) [[documentation]](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/)

Reload or restart on changes:
* Reload:
  * Signal: `docker exec -it daml_observability_prometheus -- kill -HUP 1`
  * HTTP: `curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload`
* Restart: `docker compose restart prometheus`

### Grafana

* Grafana itself: [`grafana.ini`](./grafana/grafana.ini) [[documentation]](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/)
* Data sources: [`datasources.yml`](./grafana/datasources.yml) [[documentation]](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/)
* Dashboard providers: [`dashboards.yml`](./grafana/dashboards.yml) [[documentation]](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/#dashboards)

Restart on changes: `docker compose restart grafana`

#### Dashboards

All dashboards (JSON files) are auto-loaded from directory
[`grafana/dashboards/`](./grafana/dashboards/)

* Automatic: place your JSON files in the folder (loaded at startup, reloaded every 30 seconds)
* Manual: create/edit via Grafana UI

##### Examples Source

## Accessing Daml Enterprise container images

* Get credentials from Digital Asset support. You can get an access key by logging
in to [digitalasset.jfrog.io](https://digitalasset.jfrog.io) and generating an identity token in your [Artifactory profile
page](https://digitalasset.jfrog.io/ui/admin/artifactory/user_profile). If your email is john.doe@digitalasset.com,
your Artifactory username is `john.doe`.

* Log in to Digital Asset's Artifactory at `digitalasset-docker.jfrog.io`, you will be prompted for the password,
use your identity token:

```sh
docker login digitalasset-docker.jfrog.io -u <username>
```

* Set the [`.env`](./.env) file environment variables `CANTON_IMAGE` and `CANTON_VERSION` to the version you want.

### ```.env``` example configurations

* Using Daml open-source public container images (default), pulled from Docker Hub:

```sh
CANTON_IMAGE=digitalasset/canton-open-source
CANTON_VERSION=2.6.5
SDK_VERSION=2.6.5
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

* Using [Daml Enterprise](https://www.digitalasset.com/products/daml-enterprise) private container images, pulled from
Digital Asset's Artifactory:

```sh
CANTON_IMAGE=digitalasset-docker.jfrog.io/digitalasset/canton-enterprise
CANTON_VERSION=2.6.5
SDK_VERSION=2.6.5
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```
